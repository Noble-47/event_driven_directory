# Project Name

## Overview

This project is designed with **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** principles in mind, offering a modular, scalable solution for managing domain logic, database operations, and event handling.

The project separates concerns into distinct layers and modules, ensuring clean boundaries between the core business logic and infrastructure details, while relying on domain events to trigger actions in an asynchronous manner.

### Key Components

* **Domain**: Represents the core business logic through models, events, and exceptions.
* **Service Layer**: Encapsulates the business operations, coordinating between the domain and repositories.
* **Repository**: Provides a way to retrieve and persist domain models from various storage options (JSON, SQL).
* **Event Handlers**: Respond to domain events and trigger actions asynchronously.
* **Cloud**: Manages cloud operations (e.g., file storage).

## Features

* **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: The project structure focuses on modeling the core business domain using the principles of DDD.
* **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**: Events are used to decouple the flow of business logic, allowing for more scalable and responsive applications.
* **Modular Design**: Each part of the project has clear responsibilities, making it easy to extend and maintain.
* **Multiple Storage Support**: Includes support for both SQL and JSON-based storage, and can easily integrate with other database solutions.
* **Cloud Integration**: Cloud storage is abstracted into the `cloud/` module, with the ability to add new cloud providers.


## Technologies Used

   * **Python: Core programming language.**
   * **Cloudinary: For cloud storage integration.**
   * **SQL/JSON: Multiple database support via repositories.**
   * **Flask (optional): Can be added for building a web interface.**
   * **Event-Driven Architecture: Using event handlers and domain events for decoupling logic.**
